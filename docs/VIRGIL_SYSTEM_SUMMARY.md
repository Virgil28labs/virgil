# Virgil: Comprehensive System Summary

## Overview
Virgil is a sophisticated React/TypeScript web application that combines an AI-powered chatbot assistant with a comprehensive personal dashboard. It features a physics-based raccoon mascot, weather integration, location services, and multiple productivity tools, all designed with a local-first philosophy.

## Core Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 19.1** with TypeScript 5.8
- **Vite 7.0** for blazing-fast development
- **PWA** capabilities for offline functionality
- **Custom UI components** with shadcn/ui patterns

### Backend Stack
- **Express 5.1** server (port 5002)
- **Supabase** for authentication and user profiles
- **Local-first storage** using IndexedDB and localStorage

## Virgil AI Assistant

### Memory System
The chatbot implements a sophisticated memory architecture:

1. **Continuous Conversation Model**
   - Single ongoing conversation thread
   - Real-time message persistence
   - Automatic session recovery

2. **Memory Types**
   - **Active Conversations**: Stored in IndexedDB with 50-message context window
   - **Marked Memories**: User-highlighted important information
   - **Context Cache**: Performance-optimized recent message cache

3. **Storage Architecture**
   - Primary: IndexedDB (`VirgilMemory` database)
   - Backup: localStorage for active session
   - Performance: Sub-10ms read operations

### Context Awareness System

1. **DashboardContextService**
   - Real-time environmental data collection
   - Unified context aggregation
   - Subscription-based updates

2. **Context Types**
   - **Time**: Current time, date, time of day, timezone
   - **Location**: GPS/IP location, address, timezone
   - **Weather**: Temperature, conditions, humidity
   - **User**: Profile, preferences, session duration
   - **Device**: Hardware specs, network, battery
   - **Activity**: Active features, recent actions

3. **DynamicContextBuilder**
   - Intelligent query analysis
   - Relevance scoring (0-1 scale)
   - Selective context inclusion
   - Token optimization

### Dashboard App Integration

Virgil integrates with 8+ dashboard applications through a unified adapter system:

1. **Implemented Adapters**
   - **Notes**: Task management, journaling, tagging
   - **Pomodoro**: Timer state, productivity tracking
   - **Streak Tracker**: Habit monitoring, statistics
   - **Camera**: Photo gallery with metadata
   - **Dog Gallery**: Favorite dog images
   - **NASA APOD**: Space image collection
   - **Giphy**: GIF favorites
   - **User Profile**: Personal information

2. **Cross-App Features**
   - Unified search across all apps
   - Aggregated data responses
   - Real-time state synchronization
   - Direct app responses without LLM
