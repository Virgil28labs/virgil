  - ‚úÖ StreakAdapter - Habit tracking, streaks, check-ins
- **Features**:
  - Query routing to appropriate apps
  - Direct app responses without LLM
  - Real-time data synchronization
  - Context enhancement in prompts

## Research & Analysis

### Dashboard Apps Data Storage Analysis

#### Apps Using localStorage:
1. **üêï Dog Gallery** (`virgil_dog_favorites`)
   - Stores favorited dog images with URLs and breeds
   
2. **üé¨ Giphy Gallery** (`giphy-favorites`)
   - Stores favorited GIFs with full metadata
   
3. **üî≠ NASA APOD** (`virgil_nasa_favorites`)
   - Stores favorited space images with explanations
   
4. **ü•Å Rhythm Machine** (`rhythmMachineSaveSlots`)
   - Stores 5 save slots for drum patterns
   
5. **‚≠ï Perfect Circle Game** 
   - `perfectCircleBestScore` - High score
   - `perfectCircleAttempts` - Total attempts
   
6. **üî• Habit Tracker** (`virgil_habits`)
   - Complex habit data with streaks and check-ins
   
7. **üì∏ Camera** 
   - `virgil_camera_photos` - All captured photos with metadata
   - `virgil_camera_settings` - Storage settings
   - Has sophisticated quota management (50MB limit)

8. **üìù Notes** 
   - Uses IndexedDB for entries
   - localStorage only for AI toggle preference

#### Apps Without Storage:
- **üçÖ Pomodoro Timer** - No persistent storage (session only)

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Service Layer Pattern**
   - Centralized `DashboardAppService` manages all app data
   - Prevents direct coupling between Virgil and individual apps
   - Enables easy addition of new apps

2. **Adapter Pattern**
   - Each app has a standardized adapter interface
   - Consistent data access methods
   - App-specific query handling

3. **Query Routing**
   - Keyword-based routing to appropriate apps
   - Direct responses for app-specific queries
   - Fallback to LLM for general queries

4. **Memory & Context Integration**
   - Three-layer context system:
     1. Memory context (past conversations)
     2. Environmental context (weather, location, time)
     3. App context (dashboard app data)

## Remaining Implementation Plan

### Phase 3 Completion: Full Dashboard App Integration

#### 1. Create Remaining Adapters
Each adapter should implement the `AppDataAdapter` interface:

**CameraAdapter** for üì∏ Camera App:
```typescript
- Access to all saved photos
- Photo count and metadata
- Favorite photos
- Storage usage statistics
- Future: Multi-modal image analysis
```

**DogGalleryAdapter** for üêï Dog Gallery:
```typescript
- Favorite dog images
- Breed information
- Total favorites count
- Future: Dog breed recognition
```

**NasaApodAdapter** for üî≠ NASA APOD:
```typescript
- Favorite space images
- Explanations and dates
- Copyright information
- Future: Astronomy Q&A based on saved content
```

**GiphyAdapter** for üé¨ Giphy Gallery:
```typescript
- Favorite GIFs
- Categories and tags
- Usage patterns
```

**RhythmMachineAdapter** for ü•Å Rhythm Machine:
```typescript
- Saved patterns
- Pattern complexity analysis
- Musical preferences
```

**CircleGameAdapter** for ‚≠ï Circle Game:
```typescript
- High scores
- Total attempts
- Performance trends
```

#### 2. Enhanced Query Understanding
- Implement query classification for better routing
- Support complex queries spanning multiple apps
- Add query intent recognition

#### 3. Multi-Modal Capabilities (Future)
- Image analysis for photo galleries
- Dog breed recognition
- Object detection in photos
- Visual question answering

#### 4. Cross-App Intelligence
- Correlate data across apps (e.g., productivity from Pomodoro + Habits)
- Generate insights from combined app data
- Proactive suggestions based on patterns

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Unified Storage Interface**
   ```typescript
   interface StorageAdapter {
     getAll(): Promise<any[]>
     getById(id: string): Promise<any>
     search(query: string): Promise<any[]>
     getStats(): Promise<AppStats>
   }
   ```

2. **App Registration System**
   - Auto-discovery of apps
   - Dynamic adapter registration
   - Hot-reload support

3. **Query Processing Pipeline**
   ```
   User Query ‚Üí Intent Classification ‚Üí App Selection ‚Üí 
   Data Retrieval ‚Üí Response Generation ‚Üí User
   ```

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for each adapter
   - Integration tests for query routing
   - E2E tests for complete flows

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Predictive Intelligence
- Learn user patterns
- Suggest actions before asked
- Anticipate needs based on context

### 2. Advanced Personalization
- Personality adaptation based on interaction style
- Custom response formats
- User-specific shortcuts

### 3. External Integrations

- Natural conversation flow
- Multi-language support

## Technical Debt & Improvements

1. **Storage Optimization**
   - Migrate all apps to IndexedDB for better performance
   - Implement unified storage service
   - Add data compression

2. **Performance**
   - Lazy load adapters
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Optimize query routing

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation when apps unavailable
   - Better error messages
   - Recovery strategies

4. **Security**
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Add privacy controls

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New App Adapters
1. Create adapter in `/src/services/adapters/`
2. Implement `AppDataAdapter` interface
3. Register in Dashboard component
4. Add keywords for query routing
5. Test with sample queries

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Adapter correctly reads app data
- [ ] Query routing works for keywords
- [ ] Responses are accurate and helpful
