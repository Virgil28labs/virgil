# Two-Layer Tag System Documentation

## System Overview

The Notes app uses a refined two-dimensional tagging system that combines **Life Categories** (WHERE in your life) with **Action Types** (WHAT kind of content).

### Layer 1: Life Categories (6 domains)

1. **WORK** - Career, professional projects, education, business
2. **HEALTH** - Physical & mental wellness, fitness, medical
3. **MONEY** - Finance, budgeting, investments, expenses
4. **PEOPLE** - Relationships, family, friends, social
5. **GROWTH** - Learning, skills, personal development, spirituality
6. **LIFE** - Home, hobbies, daily routines, lifestyle

### Layer 2: Action Types (5 types)

1. **TASK** - Actionable to-dos, things that need to be done
2. **NOTE** - Information, facts, reference material
3. **IDEA** - Creative thoughts, brainstorms, possibilities
4. **GOAL** - Long-term objectives, aspirations, plans
5. **REFLECT** - Journal entries, personal narratives, feelings
